Many of our customers turned up for the event and could not wait to try the Cash Grab machine! There was a twist to the game this time which saw the emcee, Jia Fa, pick the lucky customers for the Cash Grab machine from a box of receipts instead of a first-come, first-served basis. This gave all customers a fair chance to play! The top winner managed to grab a total of $85 FairPrice vouchers which was quite a feat!

With that, we end off our 2011 FairPrice Xtra Hypermarket anniversary celebrations and we hope to see all of you for future events and celebrations!!

Through the years, we have implemented several initiatives which include exchanging IDs, and proximity locking systems that lock trolleys beyond a certain area. These methods were not only unable to deter trolleys from going lost, but were also costly and caused additional inconvenience to our shoppers. 

We even conducted a survey to better understand why our trolleys have gone missing. The research found that over 90% of shoppers agreed it is the shoppers responsibility to return trolleys but also cited inconvenience and laziness as top reasons for not returning. 

We hope that through public support, we can encourage others to do the right thing so that we can create an even more pleasant shopping experience for everyone.","2012-01-19T10:51:29+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thatsmyfairprice/photos/a.131176291408.112394.124299741408/10150494702516409/?type=3",NA,13,1,0,0,0,0,0,2012-01-19 10:51:29

FairPrice<U+2019>s recruitment policy has always been to hire Singaporeans first. Despite the challenges hiring people for the service industry, about 90 percent of our staff are Singaporeans or PRs. Over 80 percent of our total workforce are Singapore citizens. 

As we open more stores to serve our customers better, we also need more staff to fill all the vacancies. Besides advertising these vacancies in local dailies to hire Singaporeans and PRs, we have also worked with various agencies like CDCs, WDS,e2i, various polytechnics and ITEs to name a few. 

Unfortunately, we have not been able to fill all the vacancies and, hence, need to seek alternative manpower resources in neighbouring countries. Thanks and have a great weekend ahead!","2012-05-19T03:01:34+0000","status",NA,NA,29,3,0,0,0,0,0,2012-05-19 03:01:34

In the past three decades, many have graciously donated and received textbooks, giving these textbooks a second life while doing their part for the environment. Ms Ginny Chan, one of the many who has benefitted from this project, shares her story: 

""When me & my twin sister, Jenny were studying in upper primary level years ago, we donated & received free 2nd-hand textbooks from the Used Textbooks Project. This continued on till our secondary level.

During those times, we queued up very early in the wee hours of the morning with our father, Mr Chan Kung Leong who was then a taxi-driver with NTUC Comfort, in order to get the textbooks fast. Otherwise, the textbooks would be in a mess & disorganised as they were placed in carton boxes then; unlike nowadays where they're placed neatly on tables.

Though the used textbooks were not new or clean, the advantage of having scribbled notes from previous users were a great help for us to understand the topics better.

However, the best part was that it helped to lighten my parents' burden in our education costs as our family consists of 4 school-going children.

Really nice to know that this project is still ongoing and we know that it'll continue to benefit many other needy families just like how it has benefited us.""

A good nectarine should smell sweet, but don't worry too much about looks as the colour of the flesh does not influence the texture or taste. Some varieties have small brown sugar patches on the skin that indicate sweetness.

Store nectarines in a plastic bag for up to a week in the coldest part of your refrigerator. To accelerate ripening, you can place nectarines in a paper bag at room temperature. Be sure to refrigerate and use these fruit within two or three days.","2013-04-27T03:00:01+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thatsmyfairprice/photos/a.131176291408.112394.124299741408/10151393877131409/?type=3",NA,8,58,0,0,0,0,0,2013-04-27 03:00:01

This fruit tends to be smaller than other apricots, but is packed with vitamins and nutrients that makes it an excellent choice. Look for fruit that are firm to slightly soft to the touch, and don't worry about a green-yellowish look or small red blemishes on the cheeks as these are normal and do not affect quality.

Sugar apricots may be ripened on the kitchen counter for 2-3 days, and stored in sealed contained in the fridge for up to one week. Ripe fruit should be consumed immediately.

Ripe fruit should be consumed within a few days. Don't forget to consume bananas before they turn more brown than yellow as this indicates that the fruit is over ripe. Avoid gray tinted or dull looking bananas as these have not ripened properly.

Bananas being kept at room temperature can be hung to prevent resting bruises. You may also like to keep bananas in the produce section of the refrigerator, but remember that they may speed up the ripening of other fruits.

Enjoy bananas throughout the day. This nutrient packed fruit is portable and delicious on bread, cereal, in smoothies, or eaten by itself!

Cut pineapple stored in an airtight container and refrigerated should be use within five to seven days. Let the fruit return to room temperature before eating to improve flavor.

Consider the colour and firmness of the apricot when buying. Choose apricots that are firm to touch, plump in appearance and possess a deep orange or yellow/orange colour. A red tinge is also often present. Look for fruit that is unblemished, as apricots bruise easily. But don't panic i you do get a few bruised apricots as these are ideal for use in sauces or for moisture and flavor in baked goods.

Unripe fruit can be stored at room temperature in a paper bag until ripe. To store ripe apricots, place them in a sealed container and refrigerate them for up to one week. Remember to enjoy overripe fruit immediately, before they go mouldy or mushy.","2013-09-18T10:00:01+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thatsmyfairprice/photos/a.131176291408.112394.124299741408/10151662005071409/?type=3",NA,3,20,0,0,0,0,0,2013-09-18 10:00:01

It has come to our attention of some accusations that we process halal and non-halal meats in the same machines. We would like to assure our customers that all our staff at the halal counters have been properly trained by a specialised halal consultant to handle halal products and there are dedicated sections for displaying halal meat.

The post we have seen is both insensitive and done in poor taste.  We seek your assistance not to recirculate this misinformation and inform your friends to avoid unnecessary confusion or offence that may result from it. 

For more information, please contact us at general.feedback@fairprice.com.sg. Thank you.

Meat quality reduces each time frozen meat is defrosted and refrozen. The ice crystals within the meat actually rupture the meat fibres. During thawing, there will be a loss in moisture and the meat will be very dry and may taste different. So plan ahead and plan your portions well!

FairPrice is aware of the recent online post of a pest found at our Kang Kar Mall store. The rat had already been caught on 28th May, before the video was posted. NEA has inspected our store yesterday and no rats were found. We will continue to work with various parties to investigate the source of the rat. Furthermore, the store has since disposed all products that may have been compromised by the rat and have sanitized the area thoroughly.
 
Please be assured that should any pest be found in our stores, we will get our pest control specialists to respond within 2 hours.
 
We will continue to step up our efforts to maintain a clean environment for our customers.","2016-06-01T06:31:04+0000","status",NA,NA,24,35,0,0,0,2,11,2016-06-01 06:31:04

We understand that Mr <U+5B59><U+96E8><U+660E> (Sun Yu Ming) has since posted various comments on his Facebook page that suggests we have been negligent in managing the pest incident at our Kang Kar store. We have since identified Mr Sun as the delivery person for bread at our Kang Kar store, whom had been reported in the past for several occasions where he had short-changed the store by delivering less that what the store had ordered. The video he had posted was taken while he was replenishing stocks. Notwithstanding, we assure our customers that we continue to take proactive preventive measures to address the pest incident. Our investigations also show that the source of the pest did not originate from within store. 

We are puzzled as to why Mr Sun would feel that we are not taking the necessary action and preventive measures to address this matter considering the various efforts we have since taken and continue to take. 
 
We understand that he has continued to make inflammatory remarks, which questions our integrity, with the intention to mislead in his latest post. Should he persist in making such remarks, we will take necessary actions to protect our reputation.","2016-06-02T10:53:14+0000","status",NA,NA,347,348,2,39,12,5,154,2016-06-02 10:53:14

1) The rat that entered our premise was caught on 28 May.
2) Products suspected to be contaminated have been thrown away and the area thoroughly cleaned.
3) New rat burrows were found outside the store and Pest Control specialist conducted immediate extermination treatment and covered them. 
4) Potential entries into the store were identified and blocked.
5) Various layers of rat traps have also been laid to further prevent entry.
6) Additional cleaning operations conducted. 
7) Together with our pest control specialist, we continue to work with NEA to monitor that the area beyond our store is also treated for pest.

With Mdm Tay working on a permanent night shift and Mr Ng working on rotational shifts during the day, the couple has limited chances to see each other at home. 

Despite these odds, it does not bring them further apart. 
As Mdm Tay works just a stone<U+2019>s throw away from their home at FairPrice Telok Blangah, her loving husband will occasionally, pop by the store to catch a glimpse of his wife at work. At times, he even plans a breakfast date with her after her shift ends.   

Being in their golden years, they do not long to retire as they love what they do and value the security and stability obtained from their job.

Working as a part time cashier at FairPrice Khatib, Mdm Goh ends work by noon, just in time for a lunch date with her husband, who works as a full-time storekeeper at FairPrice Yishun Ring.

Being married for over 20 years, they started working in FairPrice during the early 2000s. It was then that Mr Lua introduced his wife to FairPrice. From then on, they do not regret their decision to work at the supermarket. 

When asked why they chose FairPrice, they readily mentioned their passion for the retail line and flexibility in working hours which enables them to manage their lives effectively.

Mr Lin Guanwen, Alvin, a team leader at FairPrice Xtra does just that, both for his colleagues and his customers. To his colleagues and subordinates, he treats them with respect and regards them as friends because he too, was once a retail assistant. As for his customers, he goes out of his way to patiently guide and assist them in their needs.

On one occasion, a customer came looking for a hamper, which was not readily available during the non-festive period. Alvin advised and guided him on some items to get to create his own DIY hamper. It is this empathy and thoughtfulness that drives him to go the extra mile for his customers.

For Ms Gan Yoke Chan, she does it whenever she interacts with her customers, especially the elderly. She understands that tiny actions can make a huge difference, which is why she puts in effort to speak slower to her elderly customers so they can hear her better or even just simply be there for them whenever they require any help. 

Many frequent customers fondly refer her as their <U+201C>Goddaughter<U+201D> due to her warm and friendly disposition. Her interactions with the customers not only help enrich their shopping experience but, also bring joy to them.

The manufacturer has advised that freezing and thawing of the product may affect the texture and consistency of the product.

We advise the public not to circulate unfounded or unverified information which may cause unnecessary public alarm, and the manufacturer is currently working with the authorities on the matter.
